# Prediction-of-flight-Delay
This research is aimed to predict a flight delay using machine learning algorithms. Linear Regression, Linear Regretion with Lasso Regularization and Polynomial Regression were used in this work.

This repo contains dataset, py-file, notebook and report with full description of problem and solution. Notebook is more readable than py-file, but py-file includes many comments.
